### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently an undergraduate student in the School of Economics and Management, Tongji University supervised by Dr. Wang Xiaolei. This fall, I'm going to continue my PhD study in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, National University of Singapore advised by Dr. Liu Yang in the field of transportation research.

My research interests mainly concerning network modeling and optimization and their implementation in transportation research, especially the shared mobility. 

Working Paper:
Forward Assignment in Dynamic Ridepooling System.

Publication:
Predicting the matching probability and ride/shared distance for each enroute ridepooling order: A mathematical modeling approach. [J]. Transportation Research Part B: Methodological. Jun Wang, Xiaolei Wang, Shan Yang, Hai Yang, Xiaoning Zhang and Ziyou Gao (Under review)
