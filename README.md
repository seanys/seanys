### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently an undergraduate student at Tongji University supervised by Dr. Wang Xiaolei. Months later, I will enroll in the National University of Singapore as a research engineer and PhD student advised by Dr. Liu Yang in ISEM&CEE.

My research interests mainly concerning network modeling and optimization and their implementation in transportation research, especially the shared mobility.
