### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently an undergraduate student at Tongji University supervised by Dr. Wang Xiaolei. Months later, I will enroll in the National University of Singapore as a research engineer and PhD student advised by Dr. Liu Yang in CEE.

My research interests mainly concerning network modeling and optimization and their implementation in transportation research, especially the shared mobility. 

Working Paper:
Forward Assignment in Dynamic Ridepooling System.

Publication:
Predicting the matching probability and ride/shared distance for each enroute ridepooling order: A mathematical modeling approach. [J]. Transportation Research Part B: Methodological. Jun Wang, Xiaolei Wang, Shan Yang, Hai Yang, Xiaoning Zhang and Ziyou Gao (Under review)
