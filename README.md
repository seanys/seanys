### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a research assistant in National University of Singapore and will enroll as a full time PhD student in Jan/2022 supervised by Dr. Liu Yang in ISEM&CEE. 

My research interests mainly concerning network modeling and optimization and their implementation in transportation research, especially the shared mobility.
